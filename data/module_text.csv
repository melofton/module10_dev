dbp_definition,"Disinfection byproducts are substances that are unintentionally created during the drinking water treatment process. Many of them are known to be carcinogens, or capable of causing cancer. There are dozens of DBPs; two common classes of DBPs are trihalomethanes (THMs) and and haloacetic acids (HAAs)."
dbp_formation,Disinfection byproducts form when naturally-occurring organic matter (NOM) in drinking water sources reacts with chlorine during the disinfection process. Organic matter is derived from living organisms and contains carbon.
environmental_data,"Some forms of naturally-occurring organic matter (NOM) can be measured using sensors deployed in a drinking water reservoir. For example, fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are both measures of NOM and can indicate the presence of DBP precursors in the water. In addition, chlorophyll-a is a measure of the phytoplankton in the water. Phytoplankton also contribute to NOM and so the presence of many phytoplankton can also indicate that DBP formation is more likely. Finally, many environmental sensors can provide data to managers in real-time or near real-time, which can help inform how much chlorine to add during the treatment process as water quality conditions change."

wtemp,"Water temperature determines which organisms can survive in the water and how quickly they grow. In addition, differences in water temperature from the top to the bottom of the water column, known as thermal stratification, can lead to differences in water quality at different depths."
stratification,"Thermal stratification refers to differences in water temperature at different depths in a reservoir. This occurs because the density of water depends on its temperature (see figure below). Denser water sinks to the bottom of the reservoir, while less dense water is at the surface."
seasonal_strat,"In summer, warmer, less dense water stays at the surface of the reservoir, while colder, denser water sinks. This leads to 'summer stratification', where the water is warmest at the surface and coldest at the sediments. In winter, if ice forms on the reservoir, 'inverse stratification' may occur. In this case, because water is densest at 4 degrees Celsius, the water is slightly warmer at depth than at the icy surface (remember, ice forms at 0 degrees Celsius!)."
turnover,"Turnover is when thermal stratification dissipates due to seasonal changes in air temperature. In the fall, turnover occurs as air temperatures decrease, cooling the surface waters. In spring, turnover occurs as ice melts. In both cases, water temperature becomes the same from the top to the bottom of the water column. When this occurs, we refer to the reservoir as 'mixed'. In practice, fall turnover can be defined as the first day in fall when the temperature difference between the shallowest and deepest depths in the reservoir is less than 1 degree Celsius."
strat_wq,"During summer stratification, water quality conditions can be very different in the surface and bottom depths of a reservoir. At the surface, warm temperatures and high light in the summer can lead to harmful algal blooms. At depth, thermal stratification prevents oxygen from the atmosphere entering the water. This may lead to depleted oxygen in the bottom of the reservoir, which can lead to water quality concerns such as release of metals (iron, manganese) and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) from the sediments. "
turnover_wq,"During fall turnover, metals and nutrients that have been released into the bottom waters of the reservoir during the summer can be released to the surface, potentially leading to high turbidity, taste and odor concerns, or harmful algal blooms."
do,Dissolved oxygen is the concentration of oxygen gas in water. It is typically measured in units of parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).
do_wtemp,"Dissolved oxygen is related to water temperature in two ways. 1) Colder water can carry more dissolved oxygen than warm water (see figure below). 2) During summer thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen may become depleted in the cold, bottom waters of the reservoir, because there is no opportunity for atmospheric oxygen to be mixed into these waters at depth."
do_wq,"Often, higher levels of dissolved oxygen are indicative of better water quality, while lower levels of dissolved oxygen are indicative of lower water quality. This is because low levels of dissolved oxygen can cause the release of metals (iron, manganese) and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) from the sediments, which may cause high turbidity, taste and odor concerns, or harmful algal blooms."

chla,Chlorophyll-a data are a useful proxy for phytoplankton biomass in lakes. Chlorophyll-a is a molecule that phytoplankton use for photosynthesis. Measuring chlorophyll-a concentrations in water can give a bulk estimate of phytoplankton concentrations. Chlorophyll-a data can be collected at a high frequency by automated sensors.
phyto_wq,"Phytoplankton are microscopic primary producers that live in the water. They are the dominant primary producers in many lakes and reservoirs. Excess phytoplankton biomass can lead to harmful algal blooms (HABs), which compromise water quality through production of toxins, production of taste and odor compounds, and creation of anoxic (low-oxygen zones), which can lead to release of metals and other undesirable compounds from reservoir sediments."
chla_wq,A reservoir may be at risk of experiencing water quality degradation due to HABs when chlorophyll-a is elevated.
forecast,A forecast is a prediction of a future event with uncertainty. A water quality forecast is a future prediction of a water quality variable (such as water temperature) with uncertainty
uncertainty,Forecast uncertainty is the set of possible alternate future conditions predicted by a model and the chance of observing each outcome. We generate multiple different predictions of the future because the future is inherently unknown. Uncertainty generally increases as the time into the future increases.
